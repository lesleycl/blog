The default Gatsby starter

.MD --> static pages
filesystems find new .md files

.md --> GraphQL --> pull data into Components

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
